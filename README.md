This is my repository for Codewars Kata. I've been working on some of these one and off for the last year but am working on uploading all completed katas then will work on refactoring and optimizing the solutions.

Looking back through some of these older kata solutions I've completed, a large majority of them can be MUCH more efficient but will periodically go back and re-work the solutions as I learn better ways of writing the same operations.
